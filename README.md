## Introduction
Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) is a new recommendation framework based on graph neural network, explicitly encoding the collaborative signal in the form of high-order connectivities in user-item bipartite graph by performing embedding propagation.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* tensorflow == 1.8.0
* numpy == 1.14.3
* scipy == 1.1.0
* sklearn == 0.19.1

## Example to Run the Codes
The instruction of commands has been clearly stated in the codes (see the parser function in NGCF/utility/parser.py).
* Gowalla dataset
```
python NGCF.py --dataset gowalla --regs [1e-5] --embed_size 64 --layer_size [64,64,64] --lr 0.0001 --save_flag 1 --pretrain 0 --batch_size 1024 --epoch 400 --verbose 1 --node_dropout [0.1] --mess_dropout [0.1,0.1,0.1]
```

* Amazon-book dataset
```
python NGCF.py --dataset amazon-book --regs [1e-5] --embed_size 64 --layer_size [64,64,64] --lr 0.0005 --save_flag 1 --pretrain 0 --batch_size 1024 --epoch 200 --verbose 50 --node_dropout [0.1] --mess_dropout [0.1,0.1,0.1]
```
Some important arguments:
* `alg_type`
  * It specifies the type of graph convolutional layer.
  * Here we provide three options:
    * `ngcf` (by default), proposed in [Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiangnan/papers/sigir19-NGCF.pdf), SIGIR2019. Usage: `--alg_type ngcf`.
    * `gcn`, proposed in [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJU4ayYgl), ICLR2018. Usage: `--alg_type gcn`.
    * `gcmc`, propsed in [Graph Convolutional Matrix Completion](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/files/deep-learning-day/DLDay18_paper_32.pdf), KDD2018. Usage: `--alg_type gcmc`.
  
* `adj_type`
  * It specifies the type of laplacian matrix where each entry defines the decay factor between two connected nodes.
  * Here we provide four options:
    * `plain`
    * `norm`
    * `gcmc`
    * `ngcf`

* `node_dropout`
  * It indicates the node dropout ratio, which randomly blocks a particular node and discard all its outgoing messages. Usage: `--node_dropout [0.1] --node_dropout_flag 1`
  * Note that the arguement `node_dropout_flag` also needs to be set as 1, since the node dropout could lead to higher computational cost compared to message dropout.

* `mess_dropout`
  * It indicates the message dropout ratio, which randomly drops out the outgoing messages. Usage `--mess_dropout [0.1,0.1,0.1]`.

## Dataset
We provide two processed datasets: Gowalla and Amazon-book.
* `train.txt`
  * Train file.
  * Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: userID\t a list of itemID\n.

* `test.txt`
  * Test file (positive instances).
  * Each line is a user with her/his positive interactions with items: userID\t a list of itemID\n.
  * Note that here we treat all unobserved interactions as the negative instances when reporting performance.
  
* `user_list.txt`
  * User file.
  * Each line is a triplet (org_id, remap_id) for one user, where org_id and remap_id represent the ID of the user in the original and our datasets, respectively.
  
* `item_list.txt`
  * Item file.
  * Each line is a triplet (org_id, remap_id) for one item, where org_id and remap_id represent the ID of the item in the original and our datasets, respectively.
